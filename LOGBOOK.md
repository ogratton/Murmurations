# PROJECT LOGBOOK

### 2017/09/29 - Week 1

* Researching topics for project.
* Looking particularly at Dr Tim Blackwell's "Swarming and Music" 

### 2017/10/06 - Week 2

* Decided on swarm music project
* Made simple swarm demos in Unity, Processing, and Python to decide which to use

### 2017/10/13 - Week 3

* Continued research and followed some tutorials for 3D graphics in python

### 2017/10/20 - Week 4

* Written basic swarm code in Python with OpenGL
* Completed Project Proposal

### 2017/10/27 - Week 5

* Refactored all current work into neater class structures
* Colour-coded swarms
* Added docstrings
* Added centre of mass calculation as first step toward sound
* Trialled Observer pattern but need more of a 'polling' approach (only get COM when needed)
* Added basic sound interpretation

### 2017/11/03 - Week 6

* Added attractors for the swarm agents
* Changed visual code from Pygame to Pyglet
	* Boids are now cubes, and attractors spheres, rather than lines
	* User can now move camera around in 3D space and snap to objects
* (Changed normal constants to prevent "overfitting" of sorts)
* Converted to numpy's r_ vector class, which doesn't seem that much faster than my own...

### 2017/11/10 - Week 7

* Added ChordInterpreter which treats each boid as a note
* Made .ini file to allow for easier tweaking of variables
