# TODO

Things that need to actually be done rather than vague ideas

* Finish lit review
* Design & Implementation sections of report
* Attractors:
	* Smaller paths for attractors/better path generation
	* Dynamic numbers of attractors
	* Attractors as food (finite, only play when near them)
	* Make speed absolute, not relative to cube
	* Implement some sort of attractor memory
* Use velocity as factor in sound events
* Key detection/dynamic scale changing
	* Lightness/Darkness dimension where the mode changes
* Improv mode (make attractors move smoothly, not teleport)
	* Could now pipe a midi file in for repeatable input
* GUIs
	* Link PyQt GUI over server
		* This includes for the no-vis version
	* Unity via server (mega extension/backup if above doesn't work)
* Fix visual rotation of boids
