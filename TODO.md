# TODO

Things that need to actually be done rather than vague ideas

* Finish lit review
* Design & Implementation sections of report
* Check the articulation dimension works
* Attractors:
	* Smaller paths for attractors/better path generation
	* Attractors as food (finite, only play when near them)
	* Make speed absolute, not relative to cube
* Not sure I like probability as a method for deciding which notes to play
* Use velocity as factor in sound events
* Dynamic cube size (determined by COG)
	* Might be a bit stagnant but worth a shot
* Key detection/dynamic scale changing
* Swarm stigmergy (two swarms at once need SOME kind of interaction)
* Improv mode (make attractors move smoothly, not teleport)
	* Can now pipe a midi file in for repeatable input
* GUIs
	* Link PyQt GUI over server
	* Unity via server (mega extension/backup if above doesn't work)
* Fix visual rotation of boids
